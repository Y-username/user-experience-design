# User Experience Design

User Experience = Organisation goals + User goals + User Interface + Interaction with a backend system (optional)
5 planes of user experience : Strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, surface
Strategy: what are we aiming to achieve and for whom?
Scope: what features (based on information form the strategy) do you want to include in your design? what's on the table and what's not(at least for now)?
Structure: How is the information structured? and is it logically grouped?
Skeleton: How the information should be implemented, and how will the user will navigate through the information/features?
Surface: What will the product actually look like? colors, typography, images, design elements, etc.?

From abstract to concrete: user needs business objectives - functional specification & content requirements - interaction design & information design - interface design, navigation design, information design - visual design
Strategic UX research: stakeholder interview - competitor review - user interviews and/or research - existing product audit - analyse and review
Strategy decision making: scoring the opportunities/problems by importance and feasibilities 
Scope: identify what needs to be done now and what can wait, sprint them into small steps
Skeleton: for most users, the UI is the system (features and usefulness matters). Data as presented: HTML&CSS, JS. Data in motion: Python or Django. Data at rest: SQL, Python, MySQL, MongoDB...
 -consistancy: main content areas for each page has the same shape
 -prograssive disclosure by navigation
 -visual group elements together in order of importance
 -the more features on the screen, the less user-friendly the screen is
 -navigation functionality: browsing, searching, filter, pagination; use representational icons;
 -good information design should be invisible
 -context and order matters
 -add wireframe: two dementional model of your finised product. Tools: Balsamiq, Marvelapp
Surface: visual language including font, layout, color, image, order, sequence and sites identity. Provide economy.

strategy: the basic business objectives, the user needs.
scope: finding out what features are on the table and what features are off the table.
structure plane: interaction design, information architecture.
skeleton plane: where you arrive at a mock-up
surface: the real product. develop a visual language that provides information and context. It also provides color, layout, fonts, images, order and sequence, and the site's identity.
